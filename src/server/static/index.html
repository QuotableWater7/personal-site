        <h3>Whoami?</h3>
        <p>
          I grew up in Massachusetts in a family with 7 kids. After studying
          Computer Science at Boston University, I made my way to the west coast
          to explore the tech world. I now live in Santa Rosa with my lovely
          wife Mia, our young daughter Claire, and our troublemaker cat
          Wellington.

          I've had lots of hobbes for as long as I can remember. I picked up
          coding in middle school when I was fascinated by the pages I could
          pull up in a web browser and wondered how they got there. My first
          website was a video game cheat code website... that mostly plagiarized
          from other cheat code websites :). I didn't foresee that this hobby
          would eventually define my professional life.

          Aside from my love of programming, I spend a lot of time learning and
          practicing guitar and piano. In my early to mid twenties I spent time
          in a band called
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf8G031zGQQ">The Release</a>
          before my life got busy and I settled into being a bedroom musician.

          I'm also an

          >. I'm obsessed with seeing my rating climb and I average a few games
          a day from my phone.
